# Kurin Flow 

An intelligent dual-container water purification system that simulates real-world chemical filtration with minimal human intervention.

---

##  Why I Made This

In many developing communities, water purification is either manual or expensive. I wanted to build a **low-maintenance, auto-correcting system** that mimics industrial purification steps using affordable electronics and chemistry.

Kurin Flow cycles contaminated water through sensor-guided pH/turbidity detection, Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ sterilization, and lime/alum treatment before filtering it back into a clean tank. The system repeats until the water meets preset purity thresholds.

## ðŸ›  How It Works

- **Container 1**: Holds incoming water, measures pH/TDS/turbidity, and doses Hâ‚‚Oâ‚‚ using a peristaltic pump.
- **Container 2**: Adds lime or alum via a servo-controlled chemical tray. Water is mixed, filtered (gravel + carbon), and returned.
- **Arduino Due**: Reads sensors and controls logic. Repeats purification up to 5 cycles, adjusting based on readings.
